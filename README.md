## Installation

Installation via composer is recommended:

```
composer require --dev editorconfig-checker/editorconfig-checker
```

Otherwise you could clone the repository and execute the script manually.

## Usage

If you installed it via composer you have a binary in your bin folder called `editorconfig-checker`.
Then you could create a script in your `composer.json` like this:

```json
"scripts": {
    "check-editorconfig": "editorconfig-checker src/*.php"
}
```

__ATTENTION!__: You could not use shell-like globbing like `src/**/*.php` to find all files.
You have to explicitly specify the directory under which is searched for certain filetypes.
So the above example would become to `src/*.php` to find all `.php` files in src and it's subdirectories.

You could also check for single files with explicit call them e.g. `editorconfig-checker src/index.php`

If you want to filter the files you could do this via the `-e|--exclude` parameter - __CAUTION__ after using this parameter you __HAVE TO__ write a single
regex or string or your files you want to check will be interpreted as the exclude pattern.

Some examples:
```sh
# will filter all files which has vendor, .git, .png or .lock in their name
bin/editorconfig-checker -d -e 'vendor|.git|.png|.lock' ./*

# will only filter all files which has vendor in their name
bin/editorconfig-checker -d -e vendor ./*

# will filter all files which has vendor or .git in their name
bin/editorconfig-checker -d -e vendor -e .git ./*

# will filter all files which has vendor in their name and doesn't include dotfiles/dotdirs (like .git)
bin/editorconfig-checker -e vendor  ./*
```

So basically: if you want to filter for a pattern you should quote it because the `|` for example is interpreted by the bash else wise, and there are many more.
If you just want to filter for one string you don't have to worry and if you want to filter for more strings you could also pass the `-e|--exclude` option more than once.

If you installed it manually you would have to do something like this:

```sh
<PATH/TO/ROOT/OF/THIS/REPOS>/bin/editorconfig-checker src/*.php
```

The exit value is 0 if no error occurred and 1 to 254 - every error adds 1 to the exit value.
255 means that there is more than 254 violations of your `.editorconfig` rules.

Usage output:
```
Usage:
editorconfig-checker [OPTIONS] <FILE>|<FILEGLOB>
available options:
-h, --help
        will print this help text
-d, --dots
        use this flag if you want to also include dotfiles/dotdirectories
-e <PATTERN>, --exclude <PATTERN>
        string or regex to filter files which should not be checked
```

## Additional Notes

I use semantic versioning so every breaking change will result in the increase of the major version.

Please be aware that this is still experimental.
If you encounter any bugs or anything else please open an issue with as many details as possible.
